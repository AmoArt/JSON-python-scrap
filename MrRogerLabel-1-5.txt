mrroger/MrRogersP1_-01.wav|i was born march twentieth nineteen twenty eight In latrobe pennsylvania.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-02.wav|at my Grandparents house, my mother's name was Nancy mcfeely rogers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-03.wav|and my dad's name Was james hillis rogers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-04.wav| and i was the, my my Mother was eh the only child left in her family and so i was the only grandchild.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-05.wav|So i was named for my grandfather, whose name was fred mcfeely.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-06.wav| and we have a speedy delivery person on our Neighborhood called mister mcfeely.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-07.wav|and he's pretty much named after my grandfather.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-08.wav|He's the kind of person who would say to you you've made this day a special day, you know i'm glad you're here.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-09.wav|he grew up in Pittsburgh, an part of a fairly large family.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-10.wav|and i didn't know, my great grandparents on that side but uh.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-11.wav|they Must have been very nurturing people.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-12.wav|i grew up in Latrobe. ah as a matter of fact.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-13.wav|There's a very famous golfer in latrobe by the name of arnie palmer.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-14.wav| and his Father deke palmer taught us both how to play golf.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-15.wav|I always say one of us did a lot more with it than the other.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-16.wav|That my grandfather mcfeely had started It was called the mcfeely brick company.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-17.wav|And they made bricks for the lining of steel furnaces, silica brick.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-18.wav|as time went on.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-19.wav|i mean dad would started out as a laborer and as time went on he.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-20.wav|He finally bought the company.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-21.wav|it was a wonderful man.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-22.wav|loved by the town. And my mother was too.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-23.wav|I think she Had something like, twenty five thousand volunteer hours at the hospital.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-24.wav| she loved being a nurse's aide, and during the second world war.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-25.wav|She eh, was in charge of making surgical dressings.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-26.wav| for the troops.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-27.wav|and i remembered as a little boy going down and seeing the people.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-28.wav| folding these gauze squares you know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-29.wav|and then they would ship them off.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-30.wav|in fact my mother as long as i could remember made.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-31.wav|At least one sweater every month.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-32.wav|and at Christmas time.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-33.wav|she had about twelve, very, close, people to her.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-34.wav| i mean there was dad and my sister.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-35.wav|and i of course and my Grandmother.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-36.wav|And she.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-37.wav|would give us each a hand knit sweater.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-38.wav|every christmas.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-39.wav|and so until she died those zipper sweaters that i wear on the neighborhood.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-40.wav|were all made, by my mother.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-41.wav|and we'd all try on the sweaters and then she would say okay now what kind do you want next year.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-42.wav|i know what kind you want freddie you want the one with a zipper up the front.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-43.wav|i think it's wonderful that you do these ah.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-44.wav| archival, tapes, because.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-45.wav|there are Ties that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-46.wav|many people.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-47.wav|don't know just watching certain programs.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-48.wav|and it makes the experience so much deeper.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-49.wav|to know from whence mr mcfeely came or from where the sweaters came from.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-50.wav| and the music.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-51.wav|you know the music is a, huge part.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-52.wav|always my way of saying who i was and how i felt.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-53.wav|in those days you didn't speak your feelings as much as express them artistically you know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-54.wav| and so i was always able to cry or laugh.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-55.wav| or say i was angry through the tips of my fingers on the piano.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-56.wav|i would go to the piano even that when i was five years old.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-57.wav| and start to play how i felt.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-58.wav|and so it was very natural for me to become a composer.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-59.wav|and having written all of the music for the neighborhood.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-60.wav|I feel as if that's one of my gifts to Children.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-61.wav|here is a way.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-62.wav|that doesn't hurt you or anybody else.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-63.wav|to say who you are and how you feel.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-64.wav|no i Don't i just remember that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-65.wav|my grandmother.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-66.wav|gave me my first piano.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-67.wav|Before that i had a little pump organ.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-68.wav|And it was twenty five dollars.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-69.wav|isn't that curious that i would remember that but that that seems like a little bit of money now.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-70.wav| but i Imagine in those days it would would have been like two hundred and fifty dollars.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-71.wav|pump organ i i just made it play.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-72.wav| and later i got a hammond Organ.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-73.wav| and started learning to play, both, hands and feet.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-74.wav|and wonderful.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-75.wav|can touch us you know it's elemental.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-76.wav|i i wonder if that's why i don't feel so close to people like.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-77.wav|yoyos been on our program quite often.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-78.wav| and he's a he's a good friend and I drive along you know in my car and sometimes.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-79.wav| i'll put on eh one of his tapes.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-80.wav|That. is an unaccompanied.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-81.wav|And i think that. this must be what heaven is like.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-82.wav|my sister was adopted when she was six months old.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-83.wav|and I was eleven years old.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-84.wav| and her name is Elaine.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-85.wav| and we teased her because she is.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-86.wav|she Thinks that i must have named lady Elaine fairchilde.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-87.wav|well i i don't know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-88.wav|lady elaine is the mischief maker and then in the neighborhood of make believe.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-89.wav| and she's the one who a.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-90.wav|who Keeps everybody honest.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-91.wav|because she is so honest herself.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-92.wav|i am so grateful to my family.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-93.wav|for having adopted her.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-94.wav|mother and dad an our grandparents are all in heaven now.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-95.wav| and she has.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-96.wav|first of all she's a very fine watercolor artist.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-97.wav|And she's also a very fine mother. and Our two nephews are exceedingly special.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-98.wav|Young men.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-99.wav|one teaches music composition Of all things at rollins college.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-100.wav|and the other has just gotten his doctorate in.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-101.wav|Something so esoteric i can hardly understand but it has to do with fungus.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-102.wav|So, i mean what a delight.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-103.wav|to be associated with that crozier family.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-104.wav|my mother and dad were both on boards.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-105.wav|of our church.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-106.wav|it was, Called the first presbyterian church of the true.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-107.wav|Or maybe it was the latrobe presbyterian church.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-108.wav|was one of the other, at any rate ah, I remember early on being very, very taken.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-109.wav| with. the kinds of things that the Ministers were talking about.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-110.wav|and.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-111.wav|he said that the Church should always be, a little bit in the red.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-112.wav|you know he he was a man of finance and so he.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-113.wav| he he knew.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-114.wav|mentalities And, he he felt that people.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-115.wav|when they had too much overflow.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-116.wav|that they, maybe just, didn't work hard enough or weren't.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-117.wav|Weren't giving. what.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-118.wav|the monies were supposed to be used for and those and that was to to be helping those who needed it.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-119.wav| but oh sure.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-120.wav| mother and dad took me to ah.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-121.wav|church school an.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-122.wav|All the time.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-123.wav|mostly photography, i I loved still photography i had my own.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-124.wav|Darkroom in the basement.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-125.wav|took the pictures, developed them, enlarged them.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-126.wav|i still love to take pictures.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-127.wav|i took pictures at.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-128.wav|in california at your place.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-129.wav|that was fun.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-130.wav|and I'm not a landscape photographer.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-131.wav|what i love to take.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-132.wav|I've just come back from from Canada where we dedicated a building in memory of Henry nouwen who was.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-133.wav|one of the great spiritual writers of our day who died suddenly a couple years ago.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-134.wav|Henry was an exceedingly intelligent person.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-135.wav| and he he he was a catholic priest.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-136.wav|Who taught. at menninger. taught at Harvard.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-137.wav| taught at yale, and finally found his home, in, a fairly obscure community.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-138.wav|Called lash which means the arc.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-139.wav|France. and this is a community that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-140.wav|the way start it was inviting two, men, who were, severely handicapped.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-141.wav|To come and live with him, that's how it all started.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-142.wav|there are now a hundred thirteen centers throughout the world.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-143.wav|And several thousand.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-144.wav|support groups, called faith and light groups throughout The world, all from that man inviting two people to come and live with him.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-145.wav|henry was a great inspiration to us.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-146.wav|And he went to live, in one of these communities in france and then moved.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-147.wav| to the one in toronto, where. he was pastor for the rest of his life.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-148.wav| these people.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-149.wav|called handicapped.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-150.wav|are the core members.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-151.wav|Of these group.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-152.wav|and these.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-153.wav|are wonderful people, that, during the dedication service for instance.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-154.wav| one young woman by the name of ellen.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-155.wav| she was right in the middle of doing some.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-156.wav| something that had been rehearsed and she noticed me sitting there and she just.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-157.wav|came right over to me and gave me a hug.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-158.wav| and then went back and did the rest of the service.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-159.wav|they helped us to be who we are.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-160.wav| because they are so much themselves.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-161.wav|i think henry found that. his last Name is n o u, w e n, now one.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-162.wav|and i just helped with a little book called now when then.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-163.wav| and it was reflections about Henry.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-164.wav| that my my good friend crista vinc.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-165.wav|Collected all of these and put together.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-166.wav|buy you you Know all that all comes from your saying that did, did we have a religious life.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-167.wav|you bet we did.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-168.wav|what continues within me.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-169.wav|is the knowledge.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-170.wav|That. each one of us can be used.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-171.wav|in perfectly wonderful way.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-172.wav|and, it, doesn't, necessarily have to do with what the world would call.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-173.wav| great talents.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-174.wav|we have people who.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-175.wav| in my experience.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-176.wav| have Influenced me.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-177.wav|for instance i go swimming every morning.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-178.wav|Well after i.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-179.wav|have a couple hours.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-180.wav|of reading and prayer.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-181.wav| and breakfast i go to this pool.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-182.wav|well there's a man who's been there for, twenty years, now.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-183.wav|twenty five years as a matter of fact.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-184.wav|who is one of the most open people.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-185.wav| he's very child like.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-186.wav|he he tells me about his experiences with mr Hand and mr hand will just talked to me.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-187.wav|we get along famously.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-188.wav|And i look forward, to my times of.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-189.wav|of Talking with jeff because.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-190.wav|just recently.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-191.wav|been another tragedy in The kennedy family life.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-192.wav| you say we must Think about this historically as if We're looking at this for.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-193.wav|fifty years in The future well.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-194.wav|the son of president Kennedy.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-195.wav| john junior was killed in an in an Airplane accident.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-196.wav|well jeff was very much invested in this and i asked him this morning.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-197.wav| why he thought, he, was so Interested in all of this media coverage he said.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-198.wav|grew up with them.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-199.wav|I was nine years old when his daddy died.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-200.wav|And so i said to him well how old were You when your dad died.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-201.wav| i think That what i.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-202.wav|all of That is that, television is an exceedingly personal medium.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-203.wav|back to us.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-204.wav|and the Story that we bring. to the screen.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-205.wav|Whatever we happen to be watching, we Bring our own story, to the screen.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-206.wav|and so Consequently it's it's like a dialogue.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-207.wav|And there are those people, who.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-208.wav|sometimes Say, the television doesn't affect us all That much.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-209.wav|well all i can say is then.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-210.wav| why Would advertisers, pay so much money, to Put their messages, on a medium.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-211.wav| that Doesn't affect us all that much.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-212.wav|i do Feel, that, what we see and hear, on the Screen.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-213.wav| is part of who we become.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-214.wav| we used To listen.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-215.wav|to a program called vic and Saved.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-216.wav| which had the most wonderful, Whimsy.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-217.wav| i loved.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-218.wav|i i think that's where The neighborhood of make believe in our Program comes from you know just.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-219.wav|i've Been rereading charlotte's web.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-220.wav|by E B White and.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-221.wav|I just marvel. at people. who.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-222.wav|are able to Use.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-223.wav|all kinds of characters.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-224.wav| to say What's on their hearts.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-225.wav|and i i love to Think that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-226.wav|that's what.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-227.wav|we do Through the neighborhood of make believe.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-228.wav|I sit and write scripts. and sometimes The words come so fast.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-229.wav|of these Characters who are talking you know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP1_-230.wav|that It's as if it's being dictated from Someplace else.;

mrroger/MrRogersP2_-15.wav| i had had two years at Dartmouth and i got one year credit at Rollins.;

mrroger/MrRogersP2_-21.wav| and she encouraged me to Do stuff on the stage i've never done Anything on the stage.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-22.wav|but she forced me, Yet in these little french productions.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-23.wav|I remember doing something eh from leg lo.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-24.wav|well at any rate.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-25.wav|i don't Think i ever wanted the, to, to be on the Stage, i'm i'm much rather doing things.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-26.wav|In in the background.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-27.wav|i graduated From rawlinson fifty one.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-28.wav|with a bachelor of Music degree.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-29.wav|And by then i was accepted, at pittsburgh, Theological.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-30.wav|called western theological seminary in pittsburgh.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-31.wav| and i was supposed to go, There. the following. fall.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-32.wav| but i went home My senior year for a vacation.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-33.wav| in in latrobe And i saw this new thing called Television.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-34.wav|and i saw people throwing Pies in each other's faces.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-35.wav|and i thought.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-36.wav|This could be a wonderful tool, for Education, why is it being used this way ?.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-37.wav|And so i i said to my parents you know i Don't think i'll go to seminary right Away.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-38.wav| i think maybe i'll go into Television.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-39.wav| and they said wait but you've Never even seen it and i said well i've Seen enough of it here.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-40.wav| that i'd like to Try so i applied.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-41.wav| for any position that i Could have at N B C in new york.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-42.wav| and i was Accepted.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-43.wav| probably because i had this Degree in music.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-44.wav|and they wanted an Assistant.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-45.wav|to work on the music programs.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-46.wav|So in, i think it was october first.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-47.wav|Of  nineteen, fifty one.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-48.wav|I started at N B C.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-49.wav|it was program with people were Dressed up.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-50.wav| and, some kinds of costumes or Something and they were.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-51.wav| they literally Were putting pies in each other's faces I i was astounded at.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-52.wav| i didn't Watch much else.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-53.wav|I just thought hey let's see what we can Do with this.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-54.wav| i think it Always has been I i always loved my teachers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-55.wav|especially The teacher for instance.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-56.wav|When i was a senior in high school.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-57.wav|a Friend of mine taught me to fly.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-58.wav| in a Little piper cub.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-59.wav|and he was so Enthusiastic about flying i know that's Why i wanted to learn.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-60.wav| and the best Teacher in the world is somebody who Loves, what he or she does, and just loves It in front of you.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-61.wav|and that's why i like To do with the neighborhood i love to Have guests.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-62.wav| and present a whole Smorgasbord of ways for the children to Choose i mean so some child might.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-63.wav|might Choose painting some child might choose, Playing the cello.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-64.wav| but there are so many Ways of saying who we are and how we Feel.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-65.wav|Ways that don't hurt anybody. and it Seems to me that is a.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-66.wav| that's a Great gift, Well television can do that all at some Time.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-67.wav| can can present enthusiastic Teachers when when i was working.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-68.wav|later but when i was working in for the master's program of child Development.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-69.wav| i was at this nursery school.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-70.wav|And the director margaret mcfarland had Invited this man from carnegie mellon to Come.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-71.wav| and just. sculpt.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-72.wav|just love clay, in Front of the children.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-73.wav|so once a week This, very fine sculptor would come and you Know just.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-74.wav|she said i don't want you Teaching sculpting i want you simply to Sit with the children.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-75.wav|and do what you Feel you'd like to do with the clay well.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-76.wav|The kids, started using clay that medium In the most wonderful ways.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-77.wav|and that Wouldn't have happened.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-78.wav|If this gifted sculptor hadn't loved Clay right in front of them.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-79.wav|television can be, such a, Fabulous teacher.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-80.wav|yes. in new york.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-81.wav|The all of television was on one floor Of the RKO building.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-82.wav|avenue of Americas.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-83.wav|I remember that you when you got off the Elevator you turn to the right and.;

mrroger/MrRogersP2_-105.wav|something that Happened, one time in switzerland those Two things.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-106.wav|i think.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-107.wav|helped me enormously.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-108.wav|mean who would have ever thought That.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-109.wav| that somebody would want my Autograph you know or want to take my Picture.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-110.wav| i that that wasn't what i was in It for.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-111.wav| this all evolved you know that That's what's so interesting, anyway.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-112.wav|when You.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-113.wav|serve people.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-114.wav|cokes and coffees an.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-115.wav|What whatever they might want.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-116.wav|you see What.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-117.wav|what people are like.;

mrroger/MrRogersP2_-123.wav|Course i went off and got the correct, Thing.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-124.wav| but.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-125.wav|The other time.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-126.wav|while i'm thinking about.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-127.wav|my wife and i were at the Same hotel.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-128.wav|very famous movie Store.;

mrroger/MrRogersP2_-131.wav|everybody Was taking her picture.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-132.wav| well.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-133.wav|i guess i Made the mistake, of asking her if it Would be all right.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-134.wav|if i could take her Picture.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-135.wav| and she said.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-136.wav|i'd rather not.;

mrroger/MrRogersP2_-138.wav|if they could.;

mrroger/MrRogersP2_-232.wav| i don't know Maybe it was just to get some attention I don't know what it was but.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-233.wav| that was One of the dramas.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-234.wav| not on screen.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-235.wav|the Major dramas in life. are never center Stage. and they're rarely.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-236.wav| under the Bright lights.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-237.wav|Off camera.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-238.wav|for people who Might.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-239.wav| be wading through all of this Material and in the archives you know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-240.wav|That might be one of the best things to Remember.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-241.wav|that the best things of life through, are way off stage.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-242.wav|Never, highly touted. You know it's.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-243.wav| it's the little epiphanies Of life.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-244.wav|that matter most it's those Moments, when somebody will tell you.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-245.wav|you Know, you really did.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-246.wav|help me in a way That you could have never known, just by Being there, and just by being you.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-247.wav|first of all i timed Programs this was.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-248.wav| Assistant and had to time the.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-249.wav| program Called the voice of firestone. and that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-250.wav|And that was scary because you know we Had to get off the air at just the right Second otherwise you'd be.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-251.wav|I floor managed the the hit parade.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-252.wav|and I'll never forget mr lantz and snooky Lanson. that used to.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-253.wav| go with the stage Hands and play craps behind the set and I'd have to say.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-254.wav| mr lanson geron next.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-255.wav|and then he Would come and get out in front of the Thing and do his song you know and then That would be over he'd go to play again.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-256.wav|And dorothy collins em her husband was the Conductor of the orchestra of the hit Parade.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-257.wav|And the, june, look, lavalley, june valley, june Valley. i never forget she had.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-258.wav|big white Suitcases and after the program, was over I helped her down to get a cab she was Going somewhere. with these big white Suitcases.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-259.wav|things you Remember.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-260.wav|You know to think that you would do Something like that live i mean we had. Seven and eight sets in one studio.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-261.wav|and Two floor managers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-262.wav|it Could be anybody On on the crew you know you were Assigned to these different programs. but Kate smith was another program that that I floor managed.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-263.wav|she was a very Imposing person. and her mother and her Dog.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-264.wav| were with her all the time, she had Some of the first contact lenses.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-265.wav| that i Had, i've ever seen i guess maybe the Earliest ones they looked like fish Bowls.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-266.wav| and they covered the entire ball Of the eye and to get them in must have Just been excruciating.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-267.wav| and she also wore A huge corset, i mean it was almost like An iron lung.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-268.wav| that that she would get in And they would pull you know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-269.wav| and she sat Behind the big, big bouquet of flowers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-270.wav|That covered up some of her but she was A enormous woman she had. one of the most.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-271.wav|Beautiful natural voices, that ever was, It was just a, glorious instrument, there Was one, funny day.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-272.wav|Didn't seem funny then. but, she was Standing in.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-273.wav|set That was a farmhouse. singing one of.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-274.wav| it wasn't when the moon comes over The mountain because that. that was Always the.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-275.wav| the opening song.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-276.wav|Farm song i guess. at any rate, i thought It was over.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-277.wav|And so i gave a cue, to the, stagehand. to Raise the scenery so that we could get On to the next scene.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-278.wav| well the song Wasn't.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-279.wav|just a little Bit left kind of a coda that she would i Guess she was going to say something. and I hadn't been told. and so the set.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-280.wav|Started to go up and on camera of course That looked like miss smith was going Down into the ground.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-281.wav|i was watching The monitor. and of course i knew exactly What had happened so then i stopped the Rising of the set.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-282.wav|but i'll never forget, It was just like having, her, descend.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-283.wav|but It was live, you know and and people were Very forgiving with live television.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-284.wav|no i i bet i did know, Ted collins, i i didn't know him personally But i but he would come in.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-285.wav| and he and Miss smith would have.;
mrroger/MrRogersP2_-286.wav|he was Producer.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-01.wav|Is your work already.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-02.wav| i think she liked the Response that she got.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-03.wav|and i remember Somebody saying to me that she. made Thirty five thousand dollars a week.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-04.wav|well it's an enormous salary any Time but in nineteen fifty one can you imagine ?.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-05.wav| all i Know is that i was constantly astounded, By her voice, and it was an absolutely Natural.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-06.wav|that instrument was So pure, it was a glorious voice.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-07.wav| i don't Know whether she was comfortable in the Medium or not she she sure knew where to Go and and what to do.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-08.wav|Well i've often said that day he was a Person who. i said to him one time mr Hayes what do you think of.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-09.wav|when you look At that, camera and know that there are Thousands of people watching you and he Said.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-10.wav|freddie, i think a one little Buckaroo !.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-11.wav|and, you know that must have Gone straight to my heart because.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-12.wav|when i Look at the camera, i think of one person, Not any specific person. but one person.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-13.wav|Very very personal, this medium.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-14.wav|if You have a.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-15.wav|that's one of the reasons i Thought that for education it would be So fabulous. because if you have.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-16.wav|someone On television, in a classroom.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-17.wav|it looks Like that person, is looking at each Student individually.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-18.wav|a life teacher Can't do that a live teacher can do Other things though.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-19.wav| there Is you'll never find me saying that any Machine, is better than a person.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-20.wav|in fact ,That, is.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-21.wav|underlined constantly in the Neighborhood.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-22.wav| for the first time i showed A computer on a tape that we did the Other day for the neighborhood.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-23.wav| and i was.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-24.wav|Insistent, that i would say there are Lots of fun things that go on here, you Know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-25.wav|but no machine.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-26.wav|can take the place Of a person this machine cannot give you A hug, it might be able to spell h u g, but It can't give you one.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-27.wav| that's obvious.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-28.wav|but you know it Might not be obvious to children.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-29.wav|and so Consequently i think it's important to.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-30.wav|Let them know how i feel.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-31.wav| i don't know the program, But when i was told that there was a Character with a television in its Stomach.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-32.wav| i was horrified.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-33.wav|anything, that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-34.wav|Makes people think, that machines are More important than people.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-35.wav|although i Have a feeling, that that is not the Purpose of that program.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-36.wav| i don't think The purpose of that program is to say That machines are more important than  People.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-37.wav| i don't know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-38.wav|but i think it would Be interesting to find out.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-39.wav| for you.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-40.wav|did i what ?.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-41.wav|western clothes, And show old western films.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-42.wav| and he would Just introduce, them and then at the end Say, see you buckaroos or something you Know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-43.wav| what fascinated me was that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-44.wav| but when the Program was over he'd go to the dressing Room.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-45.wav| on the nights that he had his Tickets he'd get into his formal clothes And go to the opera.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-46.wav| he had a box at the oh he loved the opera.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-47.wav|You often you don't know, the depth, of Someone, that you see only on television.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-48.wav|Because that person who, like like he was, Playing a part.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-49.wav| and here he is, having a Great love of classical music.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-50.wav|the voice of firestone, gabby Hayes, kate smith i mean kate smith was Every day every afternoon.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-51.wav| at the hudson Theatre.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-52.wav| n b c owned.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-53.wav|I don't know Whether it's still there or not.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-54.wav|i think Those are the only ones the n b c opera Theatre became the the most important One.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-55.wav|cause when, when i became, they Had floor manager of that then i was on.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-56.wav|In all of the production meetings. and The best part of that was hearing those Operas over and over again.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-57.wav| the ones that I floor managed i mean i know Practically a billy budd for instance.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-58.wav|i Still sing parts of.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-59.wav|billy budd king of The sea !.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-60.wav| this was a benjamin britten Opera.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-61.wav| but you'll hear all that from kirk.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-62.wav|you can cross reference.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-63.wav|i did not meet him my My great uncle knew him quite well.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-64.wav|And so whenever my great-uncle would Come to new york he would stop in and See me and then he would go and, visit With.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-65.wav|i'd like to met sarnoff Because.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-66.wav|is it apocryphal, This story.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-67.wav| that he received one of the Messages from the titanic.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-68.wav|oh he said he Did it.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-69.wav|there'd been so much talk Lately about the, the titanic you know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-70.wav|That i thought isn't that interesting This young teletype, operator.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-71.wav|might have.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-72.wav|Received one of the messages.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-73.wav|and Also i think he had a tie with.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-74.wav|i Think he took it seriously that. that Broadcasting, could enhance the public.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-75.wav| in In way i mean those operas somebody Sitting out in kansas who had never been To new york for instance.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-76.wav|to see a mall In the night visitors or trouble in Tahiti.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-77.wav| or peak down or any of the ones That we produce.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-78.wav| that talked about Enhancing culture.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-79.wav| television has such a Great chance to do that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-80.wav| and to teach Foreign languages.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-81.wav|a character in the Neighborhood a new character that we've Just introduce.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-82.wav| called the hula mouse The royal hula mouse and he lives in the Castle with king friday.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-83.wav| and he speaks Only spanish.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-84.wav|the scripts are Written in a way that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-85.wav| the english that Goes before and the english that comes After each one of his speeches.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-86.wav| the Spanish is understood.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-87.wav| i guess you know Here we go back to dartmouth and my love For romance languages.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-88.wav|so Many people writing to us saying.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-89.wav|i came From.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-90.wav| italy i came from israel i came.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-91.wav|From many different countries.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-92.wav|you Helped me to learn english.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-93.wav|because you Know they would find someone who spoke Slowly.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-94.wav|deliberately, on the air.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-95.wav|Invariably if if i'm going to talk about A cup.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-96.wav|But i think it's a wonderful dividend.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-97.wav|People from other.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-98.wav| nationalities, learning, Our language.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-99.wav| through the neighborhood.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-100.wav| that's a Wonderful question.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-101.wav|i'm sure it crosses My mind, at time.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-102.wav| but i realize i'm not There to teach english, i'm there just to Be myself.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-103.wav|and so just continue being Yourself.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-104.wav| i think i met him the First day.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-105.wav| because i had a letter of Recommendation to him.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-106.wav| and i think he Hired me.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-107.wav| now maybe he, you know i worked On those color test programs that's the Other thing that i worked on.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-108.wav| i was the first floor manager in Three k. which had the only color.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-109.wav|cameras, In new york.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-110.wav|there were three sets.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-111.wav| three Color sets that could receive these Programs.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-112.wav| general sarnoff had one.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-113.wav|and Niles trammell.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-114.wav|had the second.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-115.wav| and i Think maybe it was pat weaver who had The third.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-116.wav|there were just three sets.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-117.wav|and All we did in this studio was to move Things from one place to another so that The cameras could take pictures of them.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-118.wav|And i remember my first day on the job, Somebody said move the green parrot to The left.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-119.wav|and to have, The first.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-120.wav|floor manager for color Television to be colorblind. i think it's A kind of whimsical.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-121.wav|it Didn't make all that much difference.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-122.wav|they just wanted to see pictures in Their home, of this new thing, called.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-123.wav|Just animals.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-124.wav|there was no production.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-125.wav|it Was just things that we would bring in And put on camera.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-126.wav| and if they happen to Be turning on their sets at home where They just see something colorful.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-127.wav|parrots Were colorful.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-128.wav|Oh i think i may have been on that Detail, couple weeks.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-129.wav| but, that was Studio 3k i don't know whether they even Have it.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-130.wav|the tests Successful the tests were fine yes.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-131.wav|in Fact it was the, you know it was the r c a Color that was chosen.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-132.wav|it was chosen to be The one that would.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-133.wav|You mean now.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-134.wav|i liked Some of those programs, you know i was Impressed with the musical programs that We did.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-135.wav| there were still some that were.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-136.wav|i guess they'll always be, Pie throwing programs, but they don't Need to be in the majority.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-137.wav|Yeah i i thought television was doing.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-138.wav|was Doing good things. however i didn't feel That i could, use, all the talents that Had been given to me.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-139.wav| as a floor manager.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-140.wav|Nevertheless i think the floor manager Position is an exceedingly important one.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-141.wav|I mean for instance gabby hayes again. Said to me one day, do you realize, that You're the only face that i see.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-142.wav| even Though when i look. in the, in the camera, I'm thinking of one person, the person That i'm closest to is you.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-143.wav|he said it Makes such a difference, if the floor Manager seems interested in what you're Doing.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-144.wav| it's awful to have a floor manager.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-145.wav|so that's a real art.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-146.wav|Oh well you know there are a lot of People on the opera's but they were so Concentrated  on.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-147.wav|When something is a dramatic, thing then When it is.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-148.wav| when you're looking at the Camera and, and you're feeling. whether The people around you are enthusiastic  About what you're doing.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-149.wav|i've most wonderful floor Manager in the world niki tala. you know he He has. an advanced sense of humor.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-150.wav| he and Jimmy.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-151.wav|michael douglas was Here for quite a long time with us he Became he went to hollywood and became Michael keaton.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-152.wav| and those three on.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-153.wav|they were always Playing jokes on me. one time they put Shoes that were so small for me i Couldn't at the end of the program i Couldn't get my feet in them.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-154.wav| no that's Not true they weren't small shoes. the They were my shoes But they they had put paper at the toe.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-155.wav|such a good feeling !.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-156.wav|that was just for the rehearsal.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-157.wav|And one time you know picture picture on Our set.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-158.wav|michael was always behind there.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-159.wav|put in the. the video tape For picture picture.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-160.wav| well one day in Rehearsal. i slid this thing open and i Heard this voice say. i'm ready to hear Your confession son.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-161.wav|it was such a great. a great learning Place for me.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-162.wav| but, some of the greatest Things about it. were the people that i Worked.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-163.wav|and isn't that always the Case, i mean you can learn the mechanics Anywhere.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-164.wav| but it's the relationships.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-165.wav|that Develop i mean, Kurt browning for instance was one of The ushers in our wedding.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-166.wav|when when People work very close together.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-167.wav|to Create something that they feel has Value, that they want to give to, to their Audiences.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-168.wav| they become a community.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-169.wav|it's a real blessing to be part of A community of givers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-170.wav|if Your main, focus.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-171.wav|Happens to be the person, who is going to Be watching what you're producing. that To me is the greatest thing that you Could ever have.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-172.wav| and when people i mean That it's so so much more important. than, How many people are going to be watching.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-173.wav|what if this person who is watching, Is somehow moved.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-174.wav| to do something of Value because of what you've put on the Air, that's so much more important.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-175.wav| than That numbers of millions of people who, Who are tuned in.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-176.wav| but it's all a matter Of quality versus quantity, and if we can Only.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-177.wav| if we can only not fall for. the Numbers game.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-178.wav| we can continue to eh, to have This medium be.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-179.wav| a really thoughtful one.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-180.wav|Now i don't.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-181.wav|Those are fairly hazy days, i, so much Happened. between, those days at n b c.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-182.wav|and When i came here to pittsburgh.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-183.wav|That was a phenomenal bridge.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-184.wav|i mean when I heard that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-185.wav| educational television, Which is now called public television.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-186.wav|When educational television was going to Be starting in pittsburgh I mean only fourty miles from where i grew Up.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-187.wav|i told some of my friends at n b c that I thought that i'd put my name in and Apply for the station. they said you are Nuts !.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-188.wav| that place isn't even on the air Yet. and you're in line to be a, producer Or a director or anything you want to be Here.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-189.wav|tat was in fifty three.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-190.wav|i applied and was one of The first i think one of the first six.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-191.wav|hired, at w q e d. which, true it wasn't On the air yet.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-192.wav| we didn't go on the air Until april first of  nineteen fifty four.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-193.wav| but this was in fifty three and johanna and i moved to pittsburgh In november of fifty three. and that's when i Started at.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-194.wav|w q e d was the First, community sponsored television Station in the country.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-195.wav| there were a few Others that were linked with Universities.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-196.wav| but this was the very first ,That a whole community, decided, To underwrite.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-197.wav|Her name, was she was the general manager And her name was dorothy daniel.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-198.wav|Night on the air was a special program, And that was april first, nineteen fifty four.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-199.wav| people had Been watching the test pattern for weeks Before that.;

mrroger/MrRogersP3_-201.wav|we invited frieda henyk. who Was the commissioner, on the f c c.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-202.wav| there would have Been no, educational television, there Would have been no p b s there would have Been no channels. set aside.;

mrroger/MrRogersP3_-206.wav| what she had Championed.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-207.wav|Well she might have been.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-208.wav|we got on the Air and, showed little parts of, what, was To come.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-209.wav|And we jossie and i showed a part of the Children's corner. and somebody else Showed a part of ah.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-210.wav|we had a Music program for from, carnegie tech.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-211.wav|Lots of different excerpts, in other Words this is what you're going to see Next week.;

mrroger/MrRogersP3_-215.wav| her passion. She went on, and on, and on, and finally.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-216.wav|After she had talked i think forty minutes.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-217.wav|And we thank you for all your help but You see here's somebody. who really cared.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-218.wav|Just enormously, about what educational Television could mean in this country.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-219.wav|And i just love to think about that at Any rate, before we went on the air, on April fifth, You see april first was a thursday.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-220.wav| and Then we went, dark until monday, when Regular programming would begin and that Was april fifth.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-221.wav|on the fouth, mrs Daniel, gave us a party, all the people Who were going to be, on the air.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-222.wav| and she Gave favors at the party. and my favor, Was a little.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-223.wav|Tyger puppet.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-224.wav|Make a slit in the set. and i can poke This puppet.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-225.wav| let's call it daniel. And we'll just use it once.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-226.wav|but what We did.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-227.wav|Happened to be a clock on it.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-228.wav|and went like that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-229.wav|refer to him as daniel.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-230.wav|And that's how the puppetry began we Never expected to use puppets.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-231.wav|when I was a kid i played with puppets.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-232.wav| i mean by Then our boys. were ah, no our boys hadn't Been born yet. our boys were born in fifty nine And sixty one.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-233.wav| so i must have had them from my Childhood but i would go home.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-234.wav| the Puppets became popular.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-235.wav| but there's a Story behind every one of them but Daniel was the first. and it was because Of dorothea daniel.;
mrroger/MrRogersP3_-236.wav| that we called him Daniel stripe a tiger.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-01.wav|so i Guess i was.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-02.wav|but, when the children's corner got Going and we, you know angels, rush in.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-03.wav| it's just the opposite. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-04.wav|somebody said.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-05.wav| who wants to do a Children's program and so josie and i Said well.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-06.wav| i said well how Long do you think we all will do an hour A day, can you imagine producing an Hour a day. and so i've just combed the.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-07.wav| the Country.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-08.wav| for free films that we could put In and. all we had planned to do was that Josie would sing some songs.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-09.wav| i would play The organ for her to sing. and then she Would introduce these films.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-10.wav| i mean we Had such things as. how you grow grass And in new hampshire or something.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-11.wav|can you imagine the amount of Material that you you'd need for an hour a Day at any rate. the puppets i think Saved us.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-12.wav|daniel tiger made His appearance that very first day.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-13.wav| but After a while he, became such a, part of It because he and josie would. josie.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-14.wav|Would talk with daniel as if. that was The only person in the room, i mean it Was just magical.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-15.wav|the way they would Converse and it was all ad lib she would Tell him her problems. and he would Listen.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-16.wav| and and so we thought why don't We try some other characters. So the next one.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-17.wav|a King now i had this king puppet at home Of course these these big ones were all Made later, by the people at n b c.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-18.wav|an That's another story when we would go to Nbc on the weekends, but. uh, the king came And he was.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-19.wav| very sad because he had lost His country.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-20.wav|and his. his name was king friday the  thirteen. we just thought that was fun.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-21.wav|Because so many people are so Superstitious about friday the thirteen. that We thought let's start children out Thinking that friday the thirteen is a fun Day.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-22.wav| and every friday.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-23.wav|would be His birthday.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-24.wav| so we would celebrate his Birthday every time a friday the thirteen.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-25.wav|and that's what was so wonderful About being live.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-26.wav| when a friday the thirteenth Came you knew it and it wasn't on.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-27.wav|and so the children. would write In what they thought the name of his Country should be.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-28.wav| and one little boy Wrote in and said well if your name is King friday the  thirteen. your country should Be, calendar land.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-29.wav|and so he dubbed this boy.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-30.wav|i'll Never forget the kill t band that came From carnegie tech which is now carnegie Mellon.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-31.wav|one Evening and of course as you know Everything's live.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-32.wav|And they started to play and i was in The control room with the director.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-33.wav|None of the camera people, they played so Loud this is the bagpipes.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-34.wav| they played so Loud that the camera people couldn't Hear what the director was in the booth Was saying.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-35.wav| and so he just would make Gestures.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-36.wav|Way or this way and well these early Days are really challenging and fun There was one day that we were missing a Cameraman somebody was sick.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-37.wav| they went Out on the sidewalk and brought somebody In one of the pitts students was walking By.;

mrroger/MrRogersP4_-40.wav|Well she was working at the station she Was working with ellen.;

mrroger/MrRogersP4_-42.wav| at the pittsburgh playhouse. She had done some children's productions There and i think eventually wanted to Go. in and do children's programming.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-43.wav|mrs daniel hired her for what.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-44.wav|but of course when the Children's the coroner got going.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-45.wav|And we had a wonderful.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-46.wav|working Relationship.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-47.wav| she was a great lyricist.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-48.wav|and then she'd hand them to me and I'd I'd write melodies for them.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-49.wav| i think i'm going to like Today i think i'll call it fine i'll Wrap it in ribbons and make it mine.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-50.wav|i Think i'm going to like today and when Today is through i'll catch it and keep It.;

mrroger/MrRogersP4_-61.wav| and many kids sang That before they went to sleep at night.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-62.wav|not on not on public broadcasting now i Wouldn't think. i don't think that that Would that would be allowed.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-63.wav|Everything was possible, you know.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-64.wav| in fact We sang good night got on the children's Corner at n b c.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-65.wav| saturday Programs.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-66.wav|they called us in and said We think it better that you, that you not.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-67.wav|Mentioned god on the program. and i said Well then i don't think we'll come back.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-68.wav|a lot of viewers for Our programs so they rescinded that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-69.wav|At any rate you can, you can be in an. Agent of what's good, and not, have to be, Terribly direct about it.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-70.wav|we have a song on the neighborhood That says. there are many ways to say i Love you.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-71.wav|there are many ways to say i Care about you. many ways many ways many Ways to say i love you.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-72.wav|and there are.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-73.wav|an One of the ways is working as well as You can, to bring to others, what you feel Can be nourishing in their lives.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-74.wav| it's an Offering of love. what we do.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-75.wav|before we do that i eh my next Thought was. how many clothes can you Wear. how many cars can you drive.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-76.wav|How big of a shelter do you really need ?.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-77.wav|Some people get so caught up.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-78.wav|in the Trappings of life.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-79.wav|my, Desire is to help children. realize that, Deep. and simple.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-80.wav| are far far more Important. than shallow, and complicated. And fancy.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-81.wav|everybody's fancy sure we're all Fancy on the inside.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-82.wav|and the outside.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-83.wav|you Know more about the neighborhood than i Do you you should be the one talking About.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-84.wav|yes well josie sang the opening Song.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-85.wav| and then she. she showed pictures That. kids had sent in.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-86.wav|It was very local.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-87.wav|a very local  program And. and again, the medium is so personal People felt that they knew us all.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-88.wav|and i Sat behind the the set at the organ and Played for josie to sing. and then i Would.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-89.wav|run to the, to the set where the Puppet where she and the puppets, places Were.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-90.wav|and poke the puppets through the Hole. and that's why i started wearing Tennis shoes those sneakers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-91.wav| because i Didn't want to make noise as i would run Across the studio. so i was always in Those sneakers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-92.wav|that was long before The children before the ehh neighborhood. I was comfortable in sneakers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-93.wav|and so After king friday came.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-94.wav|Tell you one thing about king.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-95.wav|one day.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-96.wav|television she came To visit. she was doing some.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-97.wav| we were live From five to six.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-98.wav|came into the Studio with this long, sable, coat on.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-99.wav|and We had seen her on on television as Molly goldberg and we thought.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-100.wav|We're afraid she's not gonna be like she, Like we thought she was you know on the Air well she got into the studio and she Ripped off this coat and she said.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-101.wav|tree.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-102.wav| and she gave henriette And they exchanged their favorite Recipes  for blintzes.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-103.wav|Castle. and said who lives down there. and Josie said king friday the thirteenth she said I want to meet him.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-104.wav| and so they came down To the castle. and the king came out and There was this fanfare and he came out And he looked at the.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-105.wav|at gertrude berg and he Said.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-106.wav| and she looked at The king and she said only night court Your majesty.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-107.wav|we had an idea where we Might like to go.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-108.wav| yes if you don't have a Monitor behind the set by you can just Be blind.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-109.wav|i didn't have.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-110.wav|feel very comfortable.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-111.wav|in fact when i worked in the Master's program of child development And worked with children at the University school.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-112.wav|i would give them a Lot of different puppets to play with.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-113.wav|times, it would help me to know What they were thinking. by the choice of the puppet That they make that they they made.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-114.wav|They chose the king, Well they might want to.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-115.wav|feel Authoritarian at that moment an an make Some pronouncements. if they chose daniel Tiger. they might be fear feeling quite shy.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-116.wav|But there was a whole array of puppet.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-117.wav|And children.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-118.wav|to here, Seemed so much safer, having the puppet Say.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-119.wav| what the child was feeling, rather Than the child himself at first. and we Found that a very very helpful tool.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-120.wav|for me To say i'm really scared do you think You could give me hug. so the difference From the from.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-121.wav| to here. that doesn't Seem very far.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-122.wav|it was, efficacious to Say the least an.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-123.wav|oh i think a lot, you know I think every one of them has a facet of Me.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-124.wav| lady lane certainly. the, the mischief Maker the fun make x the owls the Adolescent.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-125.wav|His he needs to go to. an optometrist all.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-126.wav| you came from California didn't you, haha. now where'd you Come from new york, oh good !.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-127.wav| he just went Like that haha. i'll tell you this television Business isn't that fun !.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-128.wav|when x came.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-129.wav|he didn't have a Place to live.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-130.wav| what we suggested To him was that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-131.wav|he find an acorn.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-132.wav|and so He went found an acorn and we scotch Taped it to the bottom of the set.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-133.wav|and Every day.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-134.wav|the art crew would paint, a Little more of.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-135.wav| the tree and finally the Tree was completely painted on the set.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-136.wav|We had a knothole, open the knothole and X came through.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-137.wav|You you must ask josey i'm not sure it Probably took a week or so.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-138.wav|she has a Wonderful memory.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-139.wav|it was Just a fanciful set. and, i've i remember there Were.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-140.wav|There was something that looked like.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-141.wav|Queen. Doing something in the.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-142.wav|there was no castle the only thing That was there was the cuckoo clock.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-143.wav| and Of course we incorporated that for Daniel.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-144.wav|but, the, rest of it was just.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-145.wav|fancy Free and i think. it may have been Ernie coombs. who helped, to design.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-146.wav|now Ernie combs was the person. who, was in Our art department here.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-147.wav|we sometimes Josie was late in the later years Because she had.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-148.wav|commercial program Downtown in pittsburgh that was live. and She would rush out, to here to be on the Air.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-149.wav|and so i would Call ernie in the art department i'd say Ernie.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-150.wav|Josie's not here yet will you come Upstairs and help us start the program.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-151.wav|And so he would come up and.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-152.wav|sing the Song and do what was needed with then.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-153.wav|come in When.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-154.wav|as soon as she arrive.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-155.wav|Well ernie. but when i was asked to go to Canada, to do the, the neighborhood.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-156.wav| wasn't Called the neighborhood then. they called It mr. rogers.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-157.wav| at any rate i asked him if He would come and help me. be my, Assistant puppeteer. and he came.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-158.wav|and when I left canada.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-159.wav| they didn't want me to go But we wanted to raise the boys in the United states and so we came back.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-160.wav| and i Said well why don't you build a program Around ernie.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-161.wav| and so that's how mr Dressup Came to be.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-162.wav| and ernie comes stayed, for twenty five Years. after that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-163.wav|mr dressup would Change clothes and put put all kinds of Things. on and.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-164.wav|and he had his own puppets.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-165.wav|that somebody else voiced.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-166.wav|But hopefully you'll talk with ernie, as He would be.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-167.wav| a great part of the history, To talk.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-168.wav|wonderful person. and I'm so proud of him, he.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-169.wav| he brought real Grace to children's programming in Canada.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-170.wav|Josie, will, probably tell you that, she And i gave dancing lessons, but i had a Mask on.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-171.wav| and i think that she called me Prince charming and i just.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-172.wav|kind of Arrived and we tried to show the Children how to do.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-173.wav| i'm not sure that i spoke. But i don't remember.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-174.wav| but, that would have Been the only time that i was on camera.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-175.wav|and so when i got to canada. eh fred Reines barry who was head of the Children's programming there.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-176.wav|camera i've seen you talk With kids. and i said oh fred i thought You wanted me to come and do puppets and Music which is what i've always.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-177.wav|you can do that too but i want.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-178.wav|i want You to look into the the lens and just Pretend that that's a child.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-179.wav| and we'll Just call it mr rogers let's let's Just do that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-180.wav|he was a Professor of philosophy.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-181.wav|at the University of toronto.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-182.wav|but he also, was Head of children's programming for the C b c the english network.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-183.wav|he gave me.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-184.wav|childhood in society.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-185.wav|but he Gave me one of the.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-186.wav| the first books.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-187.wav|that I read in the field of child development So he really knew.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-188.wav|said fred. I watched, the children's corner.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-189.wav| i've Watched your early programming.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-190.wav|sure Now you're sophisticated as far as the Child development themes are concerned.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-191.wav|But you were always, in touch with your Own childhood. and she said and that.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-192.wav|greatest prerequisite. for what You're doing.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-193.wav|think now.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-194.wav|parents, who are watching with their Children watching our neighborhood with Their children.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-195.wav|the neighborhood revokes, their own childhood, you know when They were watching.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-196.wav| that could be one of The greatest gifts that we're giving the Next generation.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-197.wav| because if they're in Touch with who they were as children.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-198.wav|They'll be able to be far more empathic, With their own children.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-199.wav|i think josie would probably tell You we just went into the studio and had Fun.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-200.wav| and again we're talking about. being Enthusiastic about healthy things.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-201.wav| i mean She and daniel would have this.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-202.wav|Conversations about.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-203.wav| a flower.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-204.wav|to Be enthusiastic about. something that. Somebody else might learn to love.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-205.wav|what are your Hobbies for instance.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-206.wav|do you have a hobby ?.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-207.wav|Enthusiastic of.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-208.wav|to some young person. who Is just learning to write, and say.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-209.wav|Blessing to pass on. something, that you Love, to somebody else that, there isn't Anything better.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-210.wav|There isn't any better gift.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-211.wav|That was the very first thing we Produced it was on that night, that april First night it was the only segment.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-212.wav| that We had ready to go for the children's Corner.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-213.wav| these were pieces of furniture That came alive when josie went to visit Them.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-214.wav| and there was rhododendron. and Philodendron these were just pot potted Plants.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-215.wav| and. philodendron.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-216.wav|And rhododendron was my wife.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-217.wav|we all did Recordings of these things. and josie was Fufu fish, just a, a kind of a rubber fish Ohh.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-218.wav| talk about primitive.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-219.wav|there was Grandma, Victoria ola phone. it was gramophone.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-220.wav|and She got converted. into a television set.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-221.wav| the director did her voice john Ziegler did.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-222.wav|which was a mouse It was a puppet. but that's poet spelled Backwards.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-223.wav|and everything that he said Was in poetry.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-224.wav|they've scripted, those were completely scripted, yeah.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-225.wav|In fact josie wrote a lot of those.;
mrroger/MrRogersP4_-226.wav|they were funny.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-01.wav|producer from n b c came to see Ben spock.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-02.wav| who was doing a program on W q e d call.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-03.wav|parents and doctor spock.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-04.wav|and While she was waiting for that program To come on she was.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-05.wav| sitting in the lobby And watching the set and all of a sudden The children's corner came on.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-06.wav|and she Looked at it and she said i think that's Something that n b c might be interested In her name was doris ann.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-07.wav| and she was Head of religious programming for n b c.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-08.wav|And so she presented it to the network And.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-09.wav| asked if we would come and Replace.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-10.wav|for the four weeks that they Would be on vacation.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-11.wav| and so Josie and i flew to new york.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-12.wav| and had Meetings with all these people and they The only suggestion that they made was That we have larger puppets.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-13.wav| our puppets Were quite small.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-14.wav|and so we said well we Don't know how to, do that and they said We'll have them made for you.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-15.wav| and so they, Had a puppet maker talk with us, and That's when.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-16.wav| we went over and did Those four programs and the response was.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-17.wav|that when winchell and mahoney Came back to do their regular program They said well we'd like you to do one Too.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-18.wav| now. we did i don't know how many Weeks we did that, a long time. year or so.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-19.wav|We would do the, children's corner all Week long.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-20.wav|and then on friday we would Fly to new york have a production Meeting do this program saturday morning.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-21.wav|Fly back, do the.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-22.wav|an hour each And the sixth one was a half hour.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-23.wav| just amazing that. that you Could go on the air an.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-24.wav| and have such a an Easy, dialogue.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-25.wav|Definitely was never seen, it was josie In the puppets.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-26.wav|but francis horwich was Head of children's programming then.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-27.wav|N b c and she had a program called Ding dong school.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-28.wav|and i remember her.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-29.wav|her Saying, you know the days of children's Programming here. are limited. so don't be Surprised.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-30.wav| if somebody says, we don't want You anymore. well we were called, couple Weeks later.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-31.wav|to the office of one of the Vice presidents.;

mrroger/MrRogersP5_-33.wav|you all have done very well With the children's corner.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-34.wav|on saturday Morning.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-35.wav| i must say though, that my child.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-36.wav|invested in that program. i figure, That it can't be for the masses.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-37.wav|so that was his way of saying oh you Finish out this contract, and not come Back.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-38.wav|for for A half an hour each week.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-39.wav|doctor spock was the Medical director of the place where i Did my practical work.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-40.wav| the arsenal Family and children's center.;

mrroger/MrRogersP5_-56.wav|rewind that tape for just about A minute.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-57.wav|try to find my train of Thought.;

mrroger/MrRogersP5_-129.wav| and the first course that i Took was systematic theology with doctor William ore.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-130.wav| and doctor ore turned out.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-131.wav|one of the greatest professors i ever Had.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-132.wav| and that was the beginning of the, Seminary training and it took me eight Years.;

mrroger/MrRogersP5_-141.wav| his forgiveness, he Said. it simply. disintegrates, in the Presence of forgiveness.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-142.wav|This was doctor or himself.;

mrroger/MrRogersP5_-144.wav| flick his ash In the wastebasket and one one time it Caught fire.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-145.wav| and he was lecturing. and he Just.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-146.wav|teachers that i Have had. i mean, you're, you're blessed to Have one teacher.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-147.wav|mean doctor or and and margaret Mcfarland.;

mrroger/MrRogersP5_-153.wav|best Things, in life are the things that you. Can't buy.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-154.wav|and can't even plan for.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-155.wav| not not yet. eh it Was after i graduated with the.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-156.wav| bachelor of divinity.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-157.wav|Sorry master of divinity m dio vid it's Called.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-158.wav| then i went on to, to, take the Master's course in counseling.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-159.wav| and the Man who was in charge of that. said.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-160.wav|i Want, you all in the class, to work with One person, for the whole semester at Least once a week.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-161.wav|and of course This would be somebody who.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-162.wav| who would Sign up to talk with you if you. an this Was a pastoral counseling course.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-163.wav|to the professor and i said Would it be all right if i worked with a Child.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-164.wav|instead of an adult, and he said the Certainly.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-165.wav| so long as you have your Supervision with doctor margaret mcfarland.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-166.wav|And that's how i was introduced to Margaret.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-167.wav| and so she helped me to Understand how you have play interviews With children.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-168.wav|The toys that you set forth. and then the Interpretation of the play.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-169.wav|and that's When we'd use so many puppets.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-170.wav|that's when i had My practicum work.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-171.wav| at the same Time as i was doing that program at the Seminary.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-172.wav| i was doing the master's Program in child development.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-173.wav|at the University of pittsburgh. and so margaret Was my.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-174.wav| my professor for both.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-175.wav| i was ordained by the Pittsburgh presbytery to work with Families through the mass media.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-176.wav|well, i, think that, that, the.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-177.wav|That the brethren were very wise.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-178.wav|because The the program was already established.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-179.wav|you know they they knew that this Was.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-180.wav|this was a decent pulpit.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-181.wav|they knew That i wasn't overtly religious in in What i was, what i was doing.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-182.wav| but i think They believed that the the holy spirit Was operative and in in the work and that's What matters.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-183.wav|When i graduated from the seminary.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-184.wav| i was Expecting to produce a program for the Presbyterian church.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-185.wav| there had been some, Conversations about.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-186.wav|we really should get Into television when why don't we do a Program.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-187.wav|so the day before Commencement.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-188.wav| i found out. that they Weren't able to raise the money, to do.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-189.wav| the day after Commencement, i had a call from fred Reines barrie saying i wanna.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-190.wav|to produce a New. fifteen minute program.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-191.wav| to go back to back With bob hommies friendly giant.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-192.wav|and i'd Like you to do it.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-193.wav| and, thinking that i Would be doing the puppets and the music I said okay.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-194.wav| so joann and the two boys And i moved to toronto rented the house.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-195.wav| said I've seen you talk with the kids fred And i want to translate that to Television.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-196.wav| because i had written, a Musical special for him.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-197.wav| it was called a Peaceable kingdom.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-198.wav| but that was fun That's sort of a preamble to the little Operas that we do on the neighborhood.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-199.wav|yes we We used the the same.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-200.wav| sort of Neighborhood of make believe they. and Then we had canadian guests come and Talk with the puppets there wasn't.;

mrroger/MrRogersP5_-207.wav|this was years later but He then became part of the hollywood Scene.;

mrroger/MrRogersP5_-209.wav|Different people an of course arnie coombs Was the assistant puppeteer.;
mrroger/MrRogersP5_-210.wav|We had a very nice year in toronto, Joanna and i like the people a lot.;
